# Generic-Synchronous-Asynchronous-FIFO-Memories
This repository contains the design and simulation files for both Synchronous and Asynchronous FIFO modules. These FIFOs are commonly used in digital systems for data buffering, clock domain crossing, and metastability mitigation, ensuring reliable data transfer between components operating at different clock frequencies.
